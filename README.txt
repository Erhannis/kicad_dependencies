Some component modules for KiCAD projects, like a micro usb power/data connection, or an eeprom chip with associated caps and resistors.  Comes as sheets, with separate areas of 4-layer PCB, and everything should be annotated with JLCPCB component IDs so you can export with their kicad plugin and it should autofill all the parts for assembly.

So far these things are like, MIT or CERN OHL v2 P (even if I've had to find a second source for the same decisions in a few places).

Note that I haven't yet physically tested these, personally; as of Aug 12 some boards are being manufactured and shipped to me.  Fingers crossed.
